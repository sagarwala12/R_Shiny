>Project Title: Do Age, Sex, and race effect the transmission and spread of COVID-19 in California? 

>Introduction: COVID has plauged us for nearly a year now. California in particular has been hit very hard with infection cases. 
    A year ago very little information was known about COVID. Over time as testing has increased, more data has become available for us to see trends and even make predictions.


>Interactive Charts
   >>Chart 1: Gender
        -As you can see from comparing data of males to females in California there very little difference in total infected
        -Upon zooming in however you can see men die more than woman from the disease. Why is this?
        - It could be men are more susceptible to coronavirus but the more likely cause is that men are just more likely to pass away from other complications(Heart disease #1) 
        
   >>Chart 2: Race
        - Latinos Have highest infection and death in California. Why is this?
        - Most likely factor is that latino population are promintely in the service industry 
        - Latinos tend to live with lots of family members, more likely to come into contact 
        - Like many other colored, less likely to have access to affordable healthcare. 
        
        
    >> Chart 3: Age
        - As you can see right away, age group 18-49 is significantly higher in infection rate. 
        - This is most likely due to the fact that the younger part of this demographic are more likely to ignore social distancing rules and spread transmission 
        - Although 18-49 has a very high positive infection rate, upon zooming into the chart you can see that this group and younger have very little death toll. 
        - 65+ has a very high death toll compared to the other demographics, even though they have a signifcantly lower infection rate. 
        
        
        
      
        
        
        
        
        
        
               
        
        
        
        
###Incomplete###
- Visualization Map needs to be linked to data
- addition of Hospital testing data
- include all data sets on data tab
